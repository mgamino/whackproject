                    <h2>Where will your home be on Wellesley's campus? </h2>

                        <p>The first year of college can be a time of uncertainty and anxiety, especially if you need particular accommodations and are concerned about finding a good fit roommate and dorm. This website, Wellesley Blue<i>prints</i>, is designed to smooth your transition by helping you identify a niche home on campus.</p>
                    
                        <p>Accessibility means different things to different people - the presence of one accomodation does not guarantee the presence of another, necessary accomodation. We want to emphasize that students should have the agency to find homes on campus that will meet their needs. We want Wellesley Blue<i>prints</i> to exist as a collaborations helping students and of administration hearing students. </p>

            <h2>So What's Next? </h2>
            <p>We propose that a position be created on each Wellesley House Council, incentivized with a guaranteed placement in that dorm next year, that would involve answering student questions submitted through a form on the website. We would create an additional page for each dorm profile with get-to-know-you information about the dorm accessability representative, an input field where students (incoming or returning) can ask questions about various form features, and an archive of questions already asked and answered for incoming students with similar concerns. </p>
            
            <p>This system would ensure the longevity of the project. We also suggest that such a website, if it contained information about all dorms and used a system of icons and traits to distinguish dorms, could eventually be implemented in the Wellesley Housing process for incoming first years.  </p>
            
            <p>Another further idea for the website are to improve the map on the main screen so that it uses an API to drop pins on the dorms that have certain accessibility features. </p>
