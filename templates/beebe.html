        <p>We wanted to create a web resource to help incoming and returning students find the most comfortable and accessible home in one of the campus dorms. We know that “accessible” means different things to different people, so instead of just breaking down buildings into broad categories of “accessible” or “not accessible,” we’ve provided information about specific traits and amenities of the buildings so that the students themselves can decide what is accessible for them. </p>
