        <h1>TELL ME WHY:</h1>
    
        <h2>We decided to do this project!</h2>
       
        <p>We want to create a web resource that will help incoming and returning students find the most comfortable and accessible home in one of the campus dorms.  </p>
            
        <p>This website will use interactive maps, existing Wellesley floorplans, photos, videos, and Q&amp;A opportunities with a current Wellesley dorm representative to introduce students to their different housing options. We want to create dorm profiles for each living space on campus that break down the pros and cons of life in a particular dorm to these categories: .... We also propose that a position be created on each Wellesley House Council, incentivized with a guaranteed placement in that dorm next year, that would involve answering student questions submitted through a form on the website. The archived questions would be left on the website as resources for incoming students with similar concerns, and this system would ensure the longevity of the project. We also suggest that such a website, if it contained information about all dorms and used a system of icons and traits to distinguish dorms, could eventually be implemented in the Wellesley Housing process for incoming first years.
